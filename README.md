# Brownian Motion
> Stochastic movements w/ Brownian Motion and Monte Carlo Simulation.

Stochastic processes typically used to map the motion of a particle can be applied to stock prices. This project uses the idea of a random walk to guess the movement of a stock. 

## Requirements
- Numpy
- Python Math

```sh
There are Python Modules that can create a simulation easily, I have chosen to write out the Mathematics
```

### Math

$$ dS_t = S_t*&mu;*dt + S_t*&sigma;*&epsilon;*\sqrt{&Delta;t} $$


## Monte Carlo Simulation

Similar to brownian motion in the sense that there is a degree of randomness.
